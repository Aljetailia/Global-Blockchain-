Step 2: Add any required methods that are needed to check if the function are called correctly
, and also add a modifier function that allows only the owner to run the changePrice function. 

pragma solidity >=0.7.0 <0.8.0;
contract FuncExample {
    
    struct Flash {
        string name;
        unit id;
        
    }
    
    mapping(address => Flash) flashOwner;
    address public owner;
    constructor() public {
        owner = msg.sender;
        
    }
    
    modifier OnlyOwner (){
        require(owner == msg.sender, "You are beautiful but not the owner");
        
        revert("do not run this function again it cost some fees");
        
    }
    function addFlash(string memory _name, unit _id) public OnlyOwner{
        
    }
}

Step 3: Add any error handling that may occur in any function
